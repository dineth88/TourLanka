The name 'Sigiriya' is derived from the Sinhala term 'Sinhagiri,' meaning Lion Rock. This site has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with evidence of human habitation dating back to around 3000 BC during the Mesolithic Period. Buddhist monks occupied the area as early as the 3rd century BC, establishing monastic settlements in the surrounding hills. In the 5th century AD, King Kashyapa I, who seized the throne from his father King Dhatusena, chose Sigiriya as his capital due to its strategic defensive position. Kashyapa built his palace atop the rock and decorated its sides with colorful frescoes. The site includes a series of frescoes depicting female figures, which are a subject of debate regarding their origin. After Kashyapa's defeat in 495 AD, Sigiriya returned to being a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its ancient urban planning and architectural achievements. The site features a complex city layout with gardens, monuments, and a sophisticated hydraulic system.
