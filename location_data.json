    "historicalData": "Sigiriya, also known as the Lion Rock, is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its history dates back to the 3rd century BC when it served as a Buddhist monastery. However, it gained prominence in the late 5th century AD under King Kasyapa I, who transformed it into a royal citadel after usurping the throne from his father, King Dhatusena. Fearing retribution from his half-brother Moggallana, who had fled to South India, Kasyapa chose Sigiriya for its defensible position atop a massive granite rock that rises approximately 660 feet high. The construction of the fortress was a monumental feat of engineering and artistry, involving thousands of workers and artisans. Kasyapa's reign (477-495 AD) saw the development of elaborate gardens, palaces, and defensive structures that showcased advanced urban planning and hydraulic engineering. The entrance featured a colossal lion's head, giving the site its name. Following Kasyapa's defeat in battle, Sigiriya fell into decline and reverted to a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Today, it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is celebrated for its historical significance and stunning frescoes depicting celestial maidens. The archaeological remains reveal a grand city layout with sophisticated water management systems and beautifully designed gardens that reflect both natural and man-made beauty."
